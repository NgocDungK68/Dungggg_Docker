## Container in Docker

**Containers** allow programmers to dockerize an application with all the necessary parts.

In some way, Docker is quite similar to virtual machine. Why Docker is so common, theses are some reasons:

- **Ease of use**: Docker is easy for every programmers. It takes advantage of container to build, test fast. Programmers can also dockerize the application on their laptop and run on public cloud, private cloud ... (***Build once, run anywhere***)

- **Speed**: Docker container is lightweight and fast, you can create and run **Docker container** in miliseconds.

- **Runtime environment and extensibility**: Docker allows to split the application's functions into seperate containers.
